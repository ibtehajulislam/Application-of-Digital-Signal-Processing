# Application-of-Digital-Signal-Processing
This repository contains the projects "Analysis of the reconstructed signal using a two-channel reconstruction FIR filter bank" and "Analysis of echo cancellation using adaptive system identification" done during the course Application of digital signal processing at the University of Windsor in winter 2018.

The object of the projects was to get equipped and involved in hands-on experience with advanced DSP tools those are extensively utilized in communication and multimedia systems.

In "Analysis of the reconstructed signal," a signal is passed through a two-channel reconstruction filter bank which constructs the uses of the analysis bank and synthesis bank that have been designed for quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank. In the analysis band, the input signal splits into two sub-bands (High-pass & low-pass band) and reconstructs at the of the synthesis band to avoid aliasing. The design part of this project is to create the synthesis bank and the goal is to find out the reconstructed signal.

"Analysis of echo cancellation using adaptive system identification" talks about the cancellation of acoustic echo, produced during teleconferencing or hands-free communication. In this project, an acoustic echo generated from a random signal added with a noise gets cancelled using Adaptive system identification with NLMS algorithm. The FIR filter is used here to produce a replica of the echo. The objective of this project is to analyze the difference between the input signal(loud-speaker) and the desired signal(microphone).
